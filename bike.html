        <p>Designed for mobile and powered by Django, the Rice Bikes app is a business-management web app I created for the Rice University Bike Shop. I was the lead developer of a team of Rice Apps, an organization centered around improving student life through technology.</p>

                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span>

            </div>

                <p>The Shop's clunky Google Drive-based system began to hold them back after a location change brought greater business. I designed the app to eliminate the inefficiencies of that system, focusing on the areas of task management, inventory management, and finance management. In its first semester of use, the Shop used the app to process over 600 transactions.</p>


                <h3>Task Management</h3>
                <p>The biggest impact of the app has been on task management. The app gives mechanics a great benefit in usability, because all task management and customer interaction can now be done in one place. This is a big advantage over the old solution using Google Forms + Sheets, or the possibility of integrating other existing management apps, such as Asana + Wufoo. </p>

                <h3>Inventory Management</h3>
                <p>The app provides key functionality for integrating inventory management with task management. Mechanics can make order requests as part of their regular workflow. And inventory managers can not only see inventory, but also can view the labor and cost that went into each bike.</p>

                <h3>Finance Management</h3>
                <p>The app improves the Shop’s insight into their sales. Google Sheets is limited to storing each transaction as a row in a spreadsheet. Extending this, the app’s relational database models allows the Shop to view revenue information categorically, so they can see where profits are really coming from.</p>
