    Hi there!

        <p>Read about the Rice Bikes App I developed here! It's an open source, mobile-friendly Django web app I developed for a local business, the Rice University Bike Shop. I was the lead developer of a team of Rice Apps, an organization centered around improving student life through technology. </p>

        <p>In terms of the technology involved, using Django was a blast. In addition to its MVC architecture, it has a lot of really useful things built-in: the ORM, migrations, user authentication, an admin site. </p>

                <div id="carouselButtons">
                    <button id="playButton" type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play"></span>
                     </button>
                    <button id="pauseButton" type="button" class="btn btn-default btn-xs">
                        <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pause"></span>
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>

                <p>I wrote the app to solve a need- the Shop's need for efficient business management in the face of a 10x increase in business from a location change. The Shop formerly used Google Drive. I created a more streamlined system by combining the Shop's three main software needs- task management, inventory management, and finance management- into one app. </p>


                <h3>Task Management</h3>
                <p>According to shop employees, the best thing about the app is task management. All task management and customer interaction can now be done in one place, on a phone. This is a big advantage over the old solution using Google Forms + Sheets, or the possibility of integrating other existing management apps, such as Asana + Wufoo. </p>

                <h3>Inventory Management</h3>
                <p>The app provides key functionality for integrating inventory management with task management. Mechanics can make order requests as part of their regular workflow. And inventory managers can not only see inventory, but also can view the labor and cost that went into each bike.</p>

                <h3>Finance Management</h3>
                <p>The app also improves the Shop’s insight into their sales. As opposed to the old Google Sheets, the app’s relational database models allows the Shop to filter revenue information, so they can see where profits are really coming from.</p>
